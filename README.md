## Troubleshooting
If the item doesn't get forged completely, it means there's an issue.  
Here are some ways to fix that.  
- Download the latest version of the script from https://github.com/teeth-eator/tfc-anvil-script
- Disable any resource packs that modify the anvil UI
- Turn on manual entry
- If the `anvil.exe` file doesn't run, install AutoHotkey and run the `anvil.ahk` file instead
- File an issue on GitHub
