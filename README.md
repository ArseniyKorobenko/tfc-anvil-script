3. Select your GUI scale
4. Click "Apply"
5. Open Minecraft **in windowed mode**

If your GUI scale is set to 1 or 2, enable the `Enter required strikes manually` checkbox  
With manual entry enabled, you will need to type in the names of the required strikes manually.  
Instead of full names, you can type in only the initials (without spaces)


## Troubleshooting
If the item doesn't get forged completely, it means there's an issue.  
Here are some ways to fix that.  
- Download the latest version of the script from https://github.com/teeth-eator/tfc-anvil-script
- Disable any resource packs that modify the anvil UI
- Try setting a higher GUI scale. GUI scales 1 and 2 are buggy due to image compression
- Turn on manual entry
- If the `anvil.exe` file doesn't run, install AutoHotkey and run the `anvil.ahk` file instead
